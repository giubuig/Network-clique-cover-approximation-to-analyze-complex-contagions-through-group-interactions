# Network-clique-cover-approximation-to-analyze-complex-contagions-through-group-interactions

We provide here the data to reproduce the results displayed in Burgio et al., _Network clique cover approximation to analyze complex contagions through group interactions_, Comms. Phys. **4**, 111 (2021) ([doi](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42005-021-00618-z)).

The source code for the computation of the edge disjoint edge clique cover (EECC), necessary for the model, is provided at [DisjointCliqueCover](https://github.com/giubuig/DisjointCliqueCover.jl).
